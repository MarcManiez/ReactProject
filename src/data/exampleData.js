It hugs the north side of the American River canyon, with some rather extreme sections of singletrack and rocks.  The first 200 yards of the trail are 'hike-a-bike' and I really mean it.  From that point forward, the Salmon Falls trail follows the contour of the cliffs.  It winds in and out of chapparel, oaks, manzanita and other lower Sierra flora.  Local fauna has been known to include the rattlesnake, coyote, deer, bovine and human life forms.  Ride with care and please remember that since it is an out-and-back trail, others may be coming your way. Technically the trail is not too bad.  The first 200 yards are the most challenging, but this is a trail that keeps you 'on your toes.'  There are many baby heads, rocks, roots and divets that can throw an unaware rider around.  It is also a great trail to learn how to ride by the seat of your pants.  Total elevation gain on the trail is somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 feet.  It is a perfect trail for those who are just getting used to riding again after a long, wet winter on the couch. You can ride this trail anytime of the year, but summers can be HOT.  Winters can be nice especially after a nice rain, since the trail is sand based and holds quite a bit of water.","length":14,"activity_type":{"created_at":"2012-08-15T16:12:35Z","id":5,"name":"mountain biking","updated_at":"2012-08-15T16:12:35Z"},"thumbnail":"http://images.singletracks.com/2009/trails/01/1139173719.jpg","rank":null,"rating":4.18}]},{"city":"Fort Bragg","state":"California","country":"United States","name":"Jughandle Ecological Trail- East Fork","parent_id":null,"unique_id":433,"directions":"From Fort Bragg:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drive south on Hwy 1 Untill you reach gibney lane.
